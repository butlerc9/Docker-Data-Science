## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Docker data science provides a development environment that is organised, reproducible and flexible. The repository has the following primary functionalities:
- A ready to run docker container built from the <a href = 'https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/'>Jupyter Docker Stacks</a> with pre-installed python packages
- An organised folder structure for data science projects
- Pre-made jupyter notebooks for data exploration, regression and modelling

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites to start coding are

1. An installation of <a href = 'https://www.docker.com/'>docker</a>
2. Any web browser OR text editor/ide with Jupyter support

### Starting a project

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
